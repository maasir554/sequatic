## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. API Key Not Working**
- Verify the key is correct in `.env.local`
- Restart the development server
- Check console for error messages

**2. AI Not Responding**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Gemini API quota
- Look for error messages in chat

**3. Analysis Not Working**
- Ensure you're in Agentic mode
- Select a table first
- Try simple analysis requests

### Debug Mode
Check browser console for detailed error logs:
```javascript
// Open browser dev tools and check console
console.log('AI Error:', error);
```

## üåü Best Practices

### For Ask Mode
- Be specific about what you want to learn
- Ask for explanations along with queries
- Request examples and use cases

### For Agentic Mode
- Select relevant tables before asking for analysis
- Use descriptive analysis requests
- Ask for specific types of insights

### Query Integration
- Always review AI-generated queries before execution
- Test queries on sample data first
- Use the "Insert Query" button for convenience

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The AI integration is designed to be extensible. Planned features include:

- **Advanced Function Calling**: More sophisticated analysis functions
